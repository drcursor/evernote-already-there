Evernote - Already there ?
=======================
Based on :
- [Everdu: chrome extension](https://github.com/bitIO/everdu-chrome-extension)
- [Frameworks](https://github.com/kassens/frameworks)

This Chrome extension shows an icon on your address bar if page already has notes on Evernote.
By clicking on that icon you can see a list of the said notes with the associated links.
